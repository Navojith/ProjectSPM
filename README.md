### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Open a terminal navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following commands:
```
# Create a virtual environment (replace 'myenv' with your preferred name)
python -m venv myenv
```
```
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

### Add your venv to the gitignore file

Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the project dependencies using pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you install anyother dependencies make sure to update the requirements.txt by running the following command
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```


### Run app
```
python main.py
```
